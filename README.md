# Google Data Analytics Capstone
### Bellabeat Case Study

In this case study, I will be working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and
meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the
data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. I have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights discovered will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present the analysis to the Bellabeat
executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

Through data cleaing in MySql and analysis in R, I present insights and strategies that can be applied to drive product improvments.
The R notebook forms the presentation of insight deliverables I would give to Bellabeat.
